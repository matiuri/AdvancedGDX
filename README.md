## What is AdvancedGDX?
**AdvancedGDX** includes all the classes that I ussualy create when I work with [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
I decided to create this library because I'm getting tired of writing the same classes for each different libGDX project, and
I published it in GitHub to be sure that I won't lose the code, and to be used by everyone who want.

## Status
At this time, **AdvancedGDX** is in early development, so some classes and methods can fail.
